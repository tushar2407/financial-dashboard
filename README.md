# Plan for financial dashboard. 

I have 3 kinds of accounts:
1. Individual == my trading account
2. 401k == my retirement account
3. Microsoft ESPP plan == my company's stock plan

ESPP plan money is my money I contribute to my trading account. 
Electronic transfers are my money I added to my trading accout. 
401K has contributions from my company and my money. 

Have a tab for segregation between the 3 kinds of accounts.

ESPP comes as credit under : JOURNALED SPP PURCHASE CREDIT (Cash)
And then deducted to buy MSFT stocks. 

I want 2 tabs, one for individual + EsPP and another for 401K. 

Add some beautiful blocks to show big metrics.
